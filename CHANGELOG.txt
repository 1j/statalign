StatAlign v3.0 on 26 Oct 2013

  New features include:

    * StructAlign plugin for alignment of protein structures
    * Introduced framework for handling extensions to the evolutionary model
    * Significant improvements to mixing on tree topologies
    * Option to keep tree fixed when phylogeny is known
    * Several new types of MCMC moves to improve mixing and convergence
    * Automatic tuning for MCMC moves
    * Restructured code to allow for easy addition of new MCMC move objects

      distribution of alignment proposal window lengths in certain cases
    * RNA mode now not activated for DNA sequences
    * Persistent regions of insertions with no descendants are stochastically 
      removed using a new type of MCMC move
